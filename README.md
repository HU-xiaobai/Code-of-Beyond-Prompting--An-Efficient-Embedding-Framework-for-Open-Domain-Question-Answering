> Large language models (LLMs) have recently pushed open-domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retrieverâ€“reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt-level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose **EmbQA**, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

## Installation

We recommend using **Python 3.11** and a clean Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n embqa python=3.11
conda activate embqa
